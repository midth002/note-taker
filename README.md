  ## Description

  This project is a Express js based application that involves different packages like utils, and file system. Users will be able to write new notes and the notes will be saved in a db.json file. Once a note is made, the note gets an id associated with it so you can click on your saved notes on the left and see what kind of texts you have in the note.
